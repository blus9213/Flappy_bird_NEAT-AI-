# Flappy Bird NEAT AI

This project implements a Flappy Bird game where artificial intelligence agents (birds) are trained using the NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies) algorithm to navigate through pipes. The goal is to evolve a neural network that can effectively control the bird's movements.

## Features

- **NEAT Algorithm**: Utilizes NEAT for evolving neural networks.
- **Real-time Simulation**: Visual representation of the game with AI-controlled birds.
- **Fitness Tracking**: Monitors the performance of each bird based on survival time and pipe navigation.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Pygame
- NEAT-Python

Install the required packages using pip:
